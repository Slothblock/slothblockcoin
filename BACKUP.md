## Backing Up Your Wallet



To create a backup of your SlothBlockCoin wallet, you will need to use the wallet's debug console. Follow these steps:



1. **Open the Wallet Debug Console:**

   - Launch your SlothBlockCoin wallet application `slothblockcoin-qt`.

   - Navigate to the `Help` menu and select `Debug Window`.

   - In the Debug Window, switch to the `Console` tab.



2. **Dump the Wallet:**

   - In the console, type the following command:

     ```
     dumpwallet "dumpfilename"
     ```

   - Replace `"dumpfilename"` with your desired filename for the backup. For example, `walletbackup.txt`.



3. **Locate the Backup File:**

   - The backup file will be saved in your data directory.

     - On **Linux**, the default directory is: `~/.slothblockcoin/backups`

     - On **Windows**, the default directory is: `%appdata%/SlothBlockCoin/backups`



## Restoring Your Wallet



To restore your wallet from a backup, you will need to import the backup file using the wallet's debug console. Follow these steps:



1. **Open the Wallet Debug Console:**

   - Launch your SlothBlockCoin wallet application.

   - Navigate to the `Help` menu and select `Debug Window`.

   - In the Debug Window, switch to the `Console` tab.



2. **Import the Wallet:**

     ```
     importwallet "fulldumpfilepath"
     ```

   - Replace `"fulldumpfilepath"` with the full path to your backup file. For example, `~/.slothblockcoin/backups/walletbackup.txt` on Linux or `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\SlothBlockCoin\backups\walletbackup.txt` on Windows.



## Additional Tips
